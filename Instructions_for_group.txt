Hello Group 6,

I have created this github repository to synchronise our team project.

Feel free to download each others sas programs, make a copy and progress through it.

Note: Always make a copy and then edit the program so that one's personal code remains unedited.

For example, i have done till importing all the files into the sas program. If you want to continue working from my program,
download my program to your computer, do whatever changes you wish and upload a new file by your name so that all files and progress 
is distinguishable


To familiarise with github commands: how to clone, add files, commit changes and push files to Github,

Thank you,
Ghayaas
